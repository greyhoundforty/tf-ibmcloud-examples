## Security Group Example

This example relies on [v0.6](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/terraform-provider-ibm/releases/tag/v0.6.0) of the IBM Cloud Provider plugin for Terraform. 

In this simple example I am creating a new Security group to resrict public SSH access to my home IP, my work IP, and the IP of a jumpbox I use when I am not at home or work. For obvious reasons I have substituted the real IPs with some from the 192.x private range.
